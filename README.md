# EduTutor AI – Personalized Learning with Generative AI

## 📌 Project Overview
EduTutor AI is an intelligent educational assistant that provides students and learners with dynamic, personalized learning tools. By leveraging **IBM's Granite generative AI models**, the assistant explains complex concepts in simple terms and generates customized quizzes for self-assessment.  

The goal is to bridge the gap between static learning materials and interactive, adaptive education — making studying more engaging and effective.

## 🚀 Features
### 🔹 Concept Explanation
- **Key Point:** Simplifies complex topics.  
- **Functionality:** Users can input any concept (e.g., *full stack development*, *machine learning*) and receive an easy-to-understand explanation generated by AI.  

### 🔹 Interactive Quiz Generator
- **Key Point:** Personalized knowledge assessment.  
- **Functionality:** Automatically generates quizzes in multiple formats (MCQs, True/False, Fill-in-the-blank).  

### 🔹 Adaptive Learning
- **Key Point:** Tailored educational content.  
- **Functionality:** Explanations and quizzes are dynamically generated based on user input.  

### 🔹 User-Friendly Gradio Interface
- **Key Point:** Accessible and intuitive platform.  
- **Functionality:** Clean web interface with text inputs and tabbed outputs.

## 🏗️ Architecture
1. **Frontend (Gradio):**  
   - Provides a simple text box and tabs for Explanation & Quiz.  
   - Focused on clarity and ease of use.  

2. **Backend (Google Colab):**  
   - Python handles user input, constructs prompts, and processes outputs.  

3. **AI Model (IBM Granite via Hugging Face):**  
   - Uses `ibm-granite/granite-3.2-2b-instruct` for generating explanations and quizzes.  

4. **Deployment (Public Gradio Link):**  
   - Hosted via Google Colab with a temporary public link.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Google account (for Colab access)  
- Internet connection  
- Hugging Face account  

### Installation
1. Open **Google Colab** and create a new notebook.  
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   !pip install transformers torch gradio -q


   EduTutorAI/
│── edututor_ai.ipynb   # Main Colab notebook
│── requirements.txt    # (Optional) project dependencies


gradio
transformers
torch

## ▶️ Running the Application
1. Open **`edututor_ai.ipynb`** in Google Colab.  
2. Run the first cell (install libraries).  
3. Run the subsequent cells (load model + build interface).  
4. The final cell outputs a **public Gradio link** (e.g., `https://12345.gradio.live`).  
5. Open the link → Enter a concept → Click **Explain** or **Generate Quiz**.
